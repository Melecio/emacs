Introduction
============

This is my portable emacs configuration.

Installation
============

Checkout the project into a directory named elisp in your home
directory::

        git clone git://github.com/nicolaslara/emacs.git ~/elisp

Make a link in your home directory pointing to the ".emacs" file
inside ~/elisp::
       
        ln -s ~/elisp/.emacs ~/.emacs

Note
----
This is an incomplete project.

Disclaimer
==========

Some of the tools are compiled for my specific installation and will
not work unless a similar setup is used.
